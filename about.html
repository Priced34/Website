            The campus tool is a website that brings everything a student will need in order to get around campus all in one place. The campus tool aims to help every student 
            in finding and making it to thier class by providing a map of the campus, parking information and locations along with a traffic report form that students can submit 
            traffic reports to let other students know how bad a traffic incident is so they can consider taking a different direction. The campus tool allows every student to have 
            a more successful college experience.
