    Feeding Meters:

<p>
Do not put anything but United States coins in parking meters. Inserting any slug, device or substitute for U.S. currency into a parking meter is a misdemeanor and will be tried by a magistrate.

    Parking Illegally or in Prohibited Areas:
</header>
<p>
    We realize it can sometimes be difficult to find parking. Please remember that your inability to locate a legal space in a parking area is never an excuse for parking illegally.
A standing vehicle is considered parked, even if someone is inside.
