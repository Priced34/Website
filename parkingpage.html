    Feeding Meters:
</header>
<p>
Do not put anything but United States coins in parking meters. Inserting any slug, device or substitute for U.S. currency into a parking meter is a misdemeanor and will be tried by a magistrate.
</p>
<header>Head-in Parking:
</header>
<p>
You can only park head-in on campus. Pull-through parking and backing into a space is not allowed.
</p>
<header>
    Parking Illegally or in Prohibited Areas:
</header>
<p>
    We realize it can sometimes be difficult to find parking. Please remember that your inability to locate a legal space in a parking area is never an excuse for parking illegally.
A standing vehicle is considered parked, even if someone is inside.
</p>

    Loss of Parking and Academic Privileges:
</header>
<p>
    If you fail to pay your parking fines, you may have your parking privileges revoked and your vehicle impounded. 
    Students who have unpaid parking fines at the end of the semester will also not be allowed to register for classes, 
    get transcripts or receive diplomas until the fines have been paid in full.
